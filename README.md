### A Game Picker for NFL Regular Seasons
**Post Season Picker on the docket**

## Abstract
This project was started by a lowerclassmen college student who likes coding and football.

## How It Began
The idea all started when I watched a YouTube video of Adam Rank predicting all the football games for the 2019 season.
...that was the one where he had the niners going 3-13 (lol), but anyways, back to my story...
I decided the way he was pushing the buttons to predict games seemed fun and it would be nice if everyone had access to a way to make predictions in such a manner.
So naturally, the first thing I did was google an NFL season predictor/picker. I found one site that worked, but was filled with ads, a hard to read UI
(user iterface), and other random content I did not like and there were no other sites like that.

So I decided to take my knowledge and enjoyment of coding and football and use it to build this season predictor for fun and for all to use (for free)!
