After writing code to update product:

1) update version numbers in about.md, package.json, and README.md
2a) git commit
2b) Delete .cache file in .firebase folder
3) npm run build
4) firebase deploy

    COMMON ISSUE: Error: Failed to get details for project: nfl-season-predictor.

    SOLUTION: run `firebase logout` then `firebase login`
