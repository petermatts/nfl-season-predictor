All of this information is about finding a custon domain for this project.
Once I have one I will need to add it to the firebase hosting section.

Google Domains: flat rate of $12/year
GoDaddy: $2.99 first year, increases after that

Google better for long run price wise, however Google is reportedly not invested in running a domain service.
